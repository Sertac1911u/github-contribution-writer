# take in desired message

# make sure it's within some limits. Length, check characters

# check the repo this will generate commits on
# -> you should copy this script to a test repo you don't care about

# check the darkest square (possible through github API?) and use that as the
# desired contribution limit per square

# parse those characters from the array set

# "this is what your message will look like, is this OK?"

# work out co-ordinates to date

# commit the shift out of that date
